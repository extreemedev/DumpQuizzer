# DumpQuizzer

DumpQuizzer is a desktop application developed using Electron and Node.js, designed to help users practice with exam dump quizzes or collections of questions and exercises from real or simulated certification exams (commonly IT-related, such as Cisco, CompTIA, Microsoft, etc.).

The main goal is to provide a simple and functional interface to simulate tests, quickly review questions, or improve exam readiness by working directly with real-world examples.
